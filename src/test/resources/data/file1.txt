Up to 10,000 prison officers in England and Wales have stopped work over claims of a "surge in violence" in jails.
It is illegal for the profession to strike, but the Prison Officers Association says "protest action" is needed to keep staff and inmates safe.
The justice secretary said the action was "unnecessary and unlawful" and would make prisons "more dangerous".
At the High Court, government lawyers seeking an injunction against the POA accused the union of trying to impose "its own limited regime" against the wishes of governors and prison service chiefs.
Daniel Stilitz QC, for the Ministry of Justice, said the POA had no legal right to instruct its members to walk out in what amounted to a strike.
"What they are doing is seeking to take over the control of jails from governors and run them on a controlled lock-down basis," he said.
"Each hour that goes by with the prisons unmanned, the danger ramps up."
But Stuart Brittenden, for the POA, insisted the officers' action was not illegal and was necessary because they were being forced to work in an "unlawful" situation because of a lack of health and safety in jails.
